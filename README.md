# Introduction

Whenever we want to watch a movie, the general thing to do is go on IMDb, check out which movie has a good rating and reviews and then select them. However, those ratings are given by the registered users, not all people
watch the movie. On the other hand, when we try to read the reviews, we can just read 5-10 reviews and then we try to judge how the movie will be like.

What if there was a way to know how the movie is reviewed by ALL the people watching it and posting reviews on IMDb, and what if you can get the top words that are used to describe the movie?

# Abstract

Nowadays, Social media has become popular places for sharing the best description of a movie through texts. Analyzing reviews or text helps in recognizing the sentiment stated by people. IMDb movie website has a lot of reviews that have been expressed by reviewers towards a movie. In the proposed work, we first get the data (the reviews) dynamically, do sentimental analysis on them and giving out the positive and the negative ratings. Getting positive and negative sentiment based on the reviews plays a significant role in text classification using sentiment analysis. As a result, we will see what the difference between our rating and IMDb is. Moreover, our system will help people find the easiest way to find the top words that describe a movie other than the genre. Also, the model will get an overall sentiment for all the reviews and will not be limited to reading a few of them.
